<h1>Kim's workout daily record</h1>
<p>It's my blog to save my information about <strong>workout <u>sets / reps</u></strong><br>
It was bummer that I couldn't save information that How much reps or sets I did exercise<br>
So, I started to make My Website. and I expect that improve my cording and English skills while making it</p>
